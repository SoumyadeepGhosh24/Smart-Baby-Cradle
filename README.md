# Smart-Baby-Cradle
Abstract: “PARENTS” the word is small, but the responsibilities are enormous. The basis of our project is Women's Empowerment; the current number of working mothers has increased greatly. For working parents, it is hardly possible to spend twenty-four hours with their infants. They need something unique that will help them to be connected with their babies most of the time. We all have heard the word “baby cradle”. Generally, it is used to make a baby sleep. Whenever a baby is crying his/her guardian comes to soothe the cradle. But in the case of working parents, it is not possible. In our project, we are going to propose a smart baby cradle using IoT to help both parents and babies. It will help the parents monitor their babies even if they are far from the user mobile application API. The system design consists of a baby cradle that will mechanically swing employing a motor   once the baby cries. Parents can also monitor their babies’ condition through an external camera and switch on the curdle-song located on the baby's cradle bed. It will be an innovative piezoelectric sensor for auto rechargeable system for the battery & smart cradle with implementing video enhancement technology, where parents can see their babies and babies can be entertained by playing pre-recorded animated videos.
